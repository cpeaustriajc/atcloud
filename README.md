I used to believe that I always have to use React and Next.js for my projects so that my portfolio will look
good and I have a good impression that I have a deep understanding of the two technologies.

But now that opinion has changed because I believe that I was prematurely optimizing my app, because I believed
that I will probably add new features after I have finished that initial implementation of the application. Turns
out I was wrong because the project went dormant for years.
